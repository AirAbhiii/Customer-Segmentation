# Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

## Overview
Customer segmentation is the process of dividing a customer base into distinct groups based on shared characteristics. This project applies the K-Means clustering algorithm to segment customers, enabling businesses to understand their audience better and tailor strategies accordingly.

---

## Project Objectives
- **Understand customer behavior**: Analyze data to identify groups of customers with similar characteristics.
- **Improve marketing strategies**: Use segmentation insights to target specific groups more effectively.
- **Increase customer retention**: Personalize offerings to match the needs of different segments.

---

## Dataset
- **Source**:  Kaggle.
- **Features**:
  - Customer ID
  - Age
  - Gender
  - Annual Income (k$)
  - Spending Score (1â€“100)

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `numpy` for numerical computations
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization
  - `sklearn` for K-Means clustering

---

## Steps to Reproduce

1. **Install required libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   Open and execute the `customer_segmentation.ipynb` file to see the step-by-step implementation.

## Key Steps in the Project
1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**
   - Load and inspect the dataset.
   - Handle missing values and clean data.
   - Normalize/scale features for better clustering performance.

2. **Determine Optimal Clusters**
   - Use the Elbow method to find the optimal number of clusters.

3. **Apply K-Means Algorithm**
   - Fit the K-Means model to the data.
   - Assign cluster labels to customers.

4. **Visualize Results**
   - Plot customer segments using 3D scatter plots.
   - Analyze the characteristics of each segment.

---

## Visualizations
- **Elbow Method**: Determine the optimal number of clusters.


## Results
- Clear segmentation of customers into distinct groups.
- Insights into spending behavior and income levels.
